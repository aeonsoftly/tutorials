1. All police officers wear a uniform. Your's will be blue, and not white which will indicate a uniform other than your's.
2. All uniforms must be pressed and kept in a single shape so no one mistakes you for "out-of-uniform".
3. When you keep your badge it must be present so others can see it so they don't mistake you for "out-of-uniform" or not a police officer at all!
4. The police officer badge is kept with your name AND number on it, so you can be known and your exact identity as well, with the police station- preferably any in the country at all!
End. Lesson 1 of 50.
